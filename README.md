# 💬 Social Media Sentiment Analysis – Prodigy Data Science Internship Project

## 🗂 Project Name
**Analyzing and Visualizing Sentiment Patterns in Social Media Data**

## 📁 File Name
`Prodigy_DS_04.ipynb`

## 👨‍💻 Project Description
This project analyzes sentiment patterns from social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward specific topics or brands. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify sentiments and visualize trends across various parameters.

This task is part of the **Prodigy Data Science Internship** and focuses on applying sentiment analysis and data visualization to real-world text data.

## ⚙ How It Works

1. **Data Loading**
   - Loads the dataset from Kaggle:  
     [Twitter_training.csv  Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jp797498e/twitter-entity-sentiment-analysis)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converts text to lowercase
   - Removes punctuation, stopwords, and special characters
   - Tokenizes and cleans tweets

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Uses `TextBlob` to analyze polarity and subjectivity
   - Classifies sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral

4. **Visualization**
   - Bar chart of sentiment counts
   - Pie chart of sentiment distribution
   - Word clouds for each sentiment category
